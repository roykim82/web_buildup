                <p>
                    Welcome to the Lotto Number Generator! Our mission is to provide you with a unique and fun way to pick your lottery numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that choosing lottery numbers should be an exciting experience. Instead of relying on random quick picks, our tool generates numbers based on an analysis of winning numbers from the past five years. This approach adds a layer of strategy and fun to the number selection process.
                </p>
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm analyzes the frequency of each number drawn in major lotteries over the last five years. It identifies "hot" and "cold" numbers and generates a combination that is statistically interesting. While we cannot guarantee a win (as the lottery is a game of chance), we offer a more engaging way to participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for using our service. We wish you the best of luck!
